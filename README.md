# @tellet/create

> Build your AI company in one command.

```bash
npx @tellet/create
```

tellet is an open-source framework that generates a complete AI-powered company from a business description. No YAML. No config files. AI creates your agent team with tailored system prompts, roles, and models.

## How it works

1. **Run one command** — answer a few questions about your business
2. **AI builds your team** — Claude generates 3-5 agents custom-tailored to your needs
3. **Deploy and go live** — `vercel deploy` and your AI company is operational

## What you get

- **AI Agents** — Customer support, marketing, sales, and more — each with business-specific system prompts
- **Dashboard** — Monitor agent activity, review conversations, track costs
- **Chat Widget** — Embeddable customer-facing chat, powered by your CS agent
- **Pluggable Architecture** — Swap LLM providers, channels, storage, and engine independently

## Architecture

Every layer is pluggable. Start with defaults, swap anything later.

| Layer | Default | Options |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Engine** | Default (lightweight) | OpenClaw (advanced orchestration) |
| **LLM** | Anthropic (Claude) | OpenAI, OpenRouter, Google |
| **Channels** | Web Chat | Slack, Email, Discord, WhatsApp |
| **Storage** | Supabase | PostgreSQL, SQLite |

Each agent can use a different LLM provider and model:

```json
{
  "agents": [
    { "id": "support", "model": "claude-haiku-4-5", "provider": "anthropic" },
    { "id": "marketing", "model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "provider": "openai" }
  ]
}
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
